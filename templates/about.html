    I am a student of NIT-Jamshedpur and I'm currently working on an ATM website. This is my first time doing any kind of coding and I was looking for a project to work on.

I have been interested in programming since I was in school. I've always liked the idea of creating my own programs and learning new things, so I decided to take up coding as my hobby.
